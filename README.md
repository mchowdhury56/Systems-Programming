# Systems Programming
Systems programming projects I have done in C on UNIX.
Projects I have done include:

junk.sh - Shell script that removes files and stores them in a separate directory.

quicksort - Sorts .txt files containing strings, integers, or doubles using quicksort with lomuto partitioning.

pfind - Finds files in a directory and its subdirectories based on file permissions given as input.

spfind - Functions the same as pfind but sorts the files using pipes.

minishell - A a separate shell that performs most of the functions the normal shell can do and can handle the SIGINT signal.

mtsieve - Finds all the prime numbers within a range of numbers using the Segmented Sieve of Eratosthene. Uses multithreading to find the primes more effectively and returns all primes in the specified range that have 2 or more digits that are 3.

chatclient - Implementation of a TCP/IP chat client using sockets and a chat server.
